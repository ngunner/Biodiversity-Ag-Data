**Title:** Disparity between agricultural and non-agricultural lands in terms of ecological observations

Target journal: ?

**Goal:** The purpose of this project is to analyze a variety of crowdsourced and other datasets to understand the disparity in ecological observations collected between agricultural and non-agricultural lands.

**Objectives:**

1. Develop a pipeline for performing statistical analysis of biodiversity and ecological observations in terms of land use where they were collected.  
2. Investigate a hypothesized disparity between observations made in agricultural vs non-agricultural lands.  
3. Propose efforts to mitigate against this disparity.

**Outline:**

1. Introduction:   
   1. Motivation  
      1. Agricultural lands make up approximately 53% of the total land area in the United States. That is more than forest and urban lands combined. Monitoring ecological activity on agricultural lands is important if we are to obtain a complete picture of national ecological health. We would like to investigate current ecological observation datasets and document any disparity between agricultural observations and non-agricultural observations.  
   2. Currently available data products  
      1. Biodiversity Observations  
         1. Global Biodiversity Information Facility \- [https://www.gbif.org](https://www.gbif.org)  
            1. Aggregates research grade observations from sources such as iNaturalist and eBird  
         2. NEON  
      2. Land-use  
         1. National Land Cover Database \- [https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database)  
         2. CroplandCROS \- [https://croplandcros.scinet.usda.gov/](https://croplandcros.scinet.usda.gov/)   
   3. Hypothesis  
      1. There is a large disparity in ecological and biodiveristy observation that favors non-agricultural lands despite the fact that agricultural lands make up the majority of terrestrial land in the United States.  
2. Materials and Methods  
   1. Workflow  
      1. Input biodiversity dataset(s)  
      2. Input land use dataset(s)  
      3. Output joined dataset  
   2. Statistical Analysis  
      1. R  
3. Results  
   1. Species level comparisons  
   2. Crop-level comparisons  
   3.   
4. Discussion  
   1. Potential factors for disparity  
      1. Where populations of observers live.  
      2. Land ownership.  
      3. Bias toward wild lands  
   2. Potential mitigation efforts & future work  
      1. Grower outreach and education  
      2. Sensor packages that automate ecological observations.  
   3. Potential issues with analysis  
      1. Inherent crowdsourced data accuracy.  
         1. Observer bias  
      2. Land-use datasetsâ€™ accuracies.  
5. Conclusion
